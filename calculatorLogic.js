    //transform given value from kg's to lbs or vise versa




    /*
    * some logic concerns : so what I'm thinking is we will have a current operator that will be stored in calculator logic
    * and only if we pass in another operator will it change other wise we will keep it the same
    * so that we have one function for calculation and it applys the logic based of that stored operator so
    * if the current displayed value is 100 and they press divide then the current operator is changed to division and when
    * they press the 10lbs or kgs button it will divide it by that amount
    *
    *
    *
    * this brings up the issue for my smaller buttons and having added values we need to have another stored value and function
    * and have to add an ='s button so that we can perform specific operations an example is what if someone wants to enter the value
    * 136 if we pressed 1 and a function is thrown we need to have a value that it can be stored in so that we can then continue to manipulate
    * value until we decide to calculate it agaisnt the current value
    *
    * we should use a string value for easy appending and then when calculating parse it and do logic
